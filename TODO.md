# When you kill other player, you get general points in that block, the killed player goes to home and his level resets, and as a bonus:
    a. YOU GET DOUBLE POINTS OF THAT SQUARE
    b. DOUBLE POINTS PLUS THIER LEVEL

# Is it better to make it safe if both tokens in same block or reward the killer extra?
